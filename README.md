Updates to ChatGPT (August 3, 2023)
-----------------------------------

We’re rolling out a bunch of small updates to improve the ChatGPT experience. Shipping over the next week:

**1\. Prompt examples:** A blank page can be intimidating. At the beginning of a new chat, you’ll now see examples to help you get started.

**2\. Suggested replies:** Go deeper with a click. ChatGPT now suggests relevant ways to continue your conversation.

**3\. GPT-4 by default, finally:** When starting a new chat as a Plus user, ChatGPT will remember your previously selected model — no more defaulting back to GPT-3.5.

**4\. Upload multiple files:** You can now ask ChatGPT to analyze data and generate insights across multiple files. This is available with the Code Interpreter beta for all Plus users.

**5\. Stay logged in:** You’ll no longer be logged out every 2 weeks! When you do need to log in, you’ll be greeted with a much more welcoming page.

**6\. Keyboard shortcuts:** Work faster with shortcuts, like ⌘ (Ctrl) + Shift + ; to copy last code block. Try ⌘ (Ctrl) + / to see the complete list.

Browsing is temporarily disabled (July 3, 2023)
-----------------------------------------------

We've [learned](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8077698-how-do-i-use-chatgpt-browse-with-bing-to-search-the-web) that the browsing beta can occasionally display content in ways we don't want, e.g. if a user specifically asks for a URL's full text, it may inadvertently fulfill this request. We are temporarily disabling Browse while we fix this.

Browsing and search on mobile (June 22, 2023)
---------------------------------------------

We’ve made two updates to the mobile ChatGPT app:

*   Browsing: Plus users can now use Browsing to get comprehensive answers and current insights on events and information that extend beyond the model's original training data. To try it out, enable Browsing in the “new features” section of your app settings. Then select GPT-4 in the model switcher and choose “Browse with Bing” in the drop-down.
    
*   Search History Improvements: Tapping on a search result takes you directly to the respective point in the conversation.
    

iOS app available in more countries, shared links in alpha, Bing Plugin, disable history on iOS (May 24, 2023)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### ChatGPT app for iOS in more countries

Good news! We’re expanding availability of the [ChatGPT app for iOS](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-chatgpt-app-for-ios) to more countries and regions. Users in 11 countries can now download the ChatGPT app in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/chatgpt/id6448311069) including the United States: Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the United Kingdom.

We will continue to roll out to more countries and regions in the coming weeks. You can track the iOS app rollout [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7947663-chatgpt-supported-countries).

#### Shared Links

We're excited to introduce a new feature: shared links. This feature allows you to create and share your ChatGPT conversations with others. Recipients of your shared link can either view the conversation or copy it to their own chats to continue the thread. This feature is currently rolling out to a small set of testers in alpha, with plans to expand to all users (including free) in the upcoming weeks.

To share your conversations:

1.  Click on the thread you’d like to share
    
2.  Select the “Share” button
    
3.  Click on “Copy Link”
    

[Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq).

#### Bing Plugin

Browse with Bing. We’ve integrated the browsing feature - currently in beta for paid users - more deeply with Bing. You can now click into queries that the model is performing. We look forward to expanding the integration soon.

#### Disable chat history on iOS

You can now disable your chat history on iOS. Conversations started on your device when chat history is disabled won’t be used to improve our models, won’t appear in your history on your other devices, and will only be stored for 30 days. Similar to the functionality on the web, this setting does not sync across browsers or devices. [Learn more](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7730893-data-controls-faq).

Web browsing and Plugins are now rolling out in beta (May 12, 2023)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a ChatGPT Plus user, enjoy early access to experimental new features, which may change during development. We’ll be making these features accessible via a new beta panel in your settings, which is rolling out to all Plus users over the course of the next week.

Once the beta panel rolls out to you, you’ll be able to try two new features:

*   **Web browsing**: Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to browse the internet to answer questions about recent topics and events.
    
*   **Plugins:** Try a new version of ChatGPT that knows when and how to use third-party plugins that you enable.
    

To use third-party plugins, follow these instructions:

In addition to the beta panel, users can now choose to continue generating a message beyond the maximum token limit. Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.

Updates to ChatGPT (May 3, 2023)
--------------------------------

We’ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:

*   You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won’t be used to train and improve our models, and won’t appear in the history sidebar.
    
*   We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.
    

Introducing plugins in ChatGPT (March 23, 2023)
-----------------------------------------------

We are announcing experimental support for AI plugins in ChatGPT — tools designed specifically for language models. Plugins can help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services. You can learn more about plugins [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).

Today, we will begin extending plugin access to users and developers from our waitlist. The plugins we are rolling out with are:

*   Third-party plugins: An experimental model that knows when and how to use external plugins.
    

You can join the waitlist to try plugins here:

Announcing GPT-4 in ChatGPT (March 14, 2023)

GPT-4 has enhanced capabilities in:

*   Advanced reasoning
    
*   Complex instructions
    
*   More creativity
    

To give every Plus subscriber a chance to try the model, we'll dynamically adjust the cap for GPT-4 usage based on demand. You can learn more about GPT-4 [here](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4).

For this release, there are no updates to free accounts.

Introducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)

*   Default: the standard ChatGPT model
    
*   Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)
    

Version selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.

Performance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)
---------------------------------------------

We're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:

1.  General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.
    
2.  Conversation history: You’ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don’t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.
    
3.  Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you’re included in this group, you’ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.
